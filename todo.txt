TESTING

run tests/checkUseStrict.py

EDITING

changing account names, transaction amounts, currencies, etc. must call redraw

LOGIN/LOGOUT

single page app, no redirects

create demo account and recreate data on login

logout must clear in-memory data

SEARCH

search by transaction description, date, amount

THROTTLE

limit to one transaction per second

IMPORT/EXPORT DATA

different formats like csv, pdf

PRIVACY

Encrypt sensitive data client-side, then save. Accounts and transactions are
lists, and decrypted data stays only in local memory. Currencies stay
unencrypted.

Encrypt: transaction and account names/descriptions, amounts, currency names
and codes

Keep ids as Firebase ids, and timestamp (when transaction occurred, not the
time when added) separate and unencrypted, in order to filter efficiently

ACCOUNT
Assets, Liabilities, Expenses, Income and Equity are default accounts but can
be edited and deleted.

CURRENCY

by default, include USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, INR, AUD, CAD, ZAR, BRL, TWD, NZD

DATA EDITING

What to do when an account is deleted? Transactions should stay, possibly show
a [deleted] label when id for an account no longer exists

DATA FLOW

Draw screens based on

1. loaded account data (from localStorage or Firebase)
2. loaded transaction data

When data is edited, everything needs to be redrawn

Test which combination of jqWidgets will be needed. The whole package is about
10 MB

See if xe.com has a live feed, show date of last quote

LOADING FROM FIREBASE

load from start of month

SETTINGS

checkbox for Liabilities, Equity and Income having negative sign (default: on)

display name (e.g. Heitor Chang)

settings must be saved
